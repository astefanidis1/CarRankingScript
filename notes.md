# Project Notes

## Timeline
- **Jan 2025**: Added Glicko ranking system for pairwise car matchups.
- **Jan 19, 2025**: Implemented tier meshing and debugging tools.

## Goals
1. Create a perfectly ranked list of all cars based on personal preference.
2. Ensure the ranking system accounts for tier meshing without distortion.
3. Add car details (images, specs) for future visualization.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge**: Overfitting Elo scores within tiers.
  **Solution**: Cross-tier matchups and debugging tools to ensure fairness.

## Ideas
- Add a web interface for easier use and better visualization.
- Include statistical insights (e.g., ranking stability, matchup history).
- Allow others to create their own ranking datasets.
