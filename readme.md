# Car Ranking Project

This project uses a custom Glicko-based ranking system to rank approximately 500 cars based on personal preferences, performance data, and subjective impressions. The goal is to create an engaging, data-driven experience that evolves rankings dynamically through tier-based matchups.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Ranking**: Glicko system with custom dynamic RD adjustments for precision and flexibility.
- **Interactive Matchups**: Cars are ranked via pairwise battles with close Elo, cross-tier, and random matchups.
- **Future Plans**: Integrate car images, audio clips, and performance data into the ranking process.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/astefanidis1/CarRankingScript.git
